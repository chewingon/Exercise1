I spent a lot of time on this assignment. From the beginning, it took me a long time to understand the problem, and writing each line of code was not easy. It was especially difficult when errors occurred because finding out what was wrong and fixing it took so much time. As I struggled, I started feeling like I wasn't good at coding, which made me a bit discouraged.

However, looking back, I realized that I learned a lot through this process. Even though I didn't complete everything perfectly, the effort I put into solving the problems helped me grow. Also, concepts that seemed confusing at first started to make more sense as I kept trying.

I still have a lot to improve, but I believe that if I keep practicing without giving up, I will gradually get better. Moving forward, I want to focus on analyzing problems more logically and breaking them down into smaller steps. Coding is not easy, but I will do my best to follow along and improve little by little!!!
